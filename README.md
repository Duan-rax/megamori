# Project Description

This project utilizes rules generated from [AdBlock DNS Filters](https://github.com/217heidai/adblockfilters) to automate the daily conversion of these rules into JSON format at midnight. Subsequently, the JSON is transformed into SRS format for further use.

I would like to extend my gratitude to the original author for their contributions. I also want to acknowledge Mosney, who created the [anti-anti-AD](https://github.com/Mosney/anti-anti-AD) project to expose the discrepancies between the actual content of anti-AD lists and the claims made by its maintainer, gentlyxu.

If you have a stance on this issue and believe that the actions of the anti-AD maintainer (gentlyxu) are correct, I kindly ask you to refrain from using my work.
